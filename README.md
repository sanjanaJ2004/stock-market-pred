STATEMENT :Stock price prediction
Develop a machine learning model in Python to predict stock prices based on
historical data. Utilize techniques such as regression or time series forecasting
to analyze features like past prices, trading volumes, and external factors. Train
the model on historical stock data and evaluate its performance using
appropriate metrics. Implement visualization tools to illustrate the predicted
vs. actual prices and provide insights into the model's accuracy. Continuously
update and refine the model to improve its predictive capabilities.

the code doesn't require any data uploading step as it will automatically take the current yr finance from yfinance but if any other data is to be added you can do it using the code 
df= pd.read_csv("copy the desired file path")
and replace df wherever needed
